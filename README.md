## React Dragable Tab Navigation

A small React component which allows you to build browser like tab experience in your React apps. This was designed as an MVP for a project I was working on which required such a feature and then I later decided to open source it, so people can use and learn from the implementation.

The drag and drop functionality is build using `react-beautiful-dnd` package.

The code is relatively simple, should be easily understandable to anyone with some React experience.
